# Line 1
# The smallest number to see would be 5, with the
# largest number being 20.
#
# Line 2
# The smallest number to see would be a 3, with the largest
# number being 9. It would not produce a 4 as the code will only
# execute odd numbers.
#
# Line 3
# The smallest number to see would be a 2.5, with the largest
# number being 5.5. The function will return any floating-point
# numbers between the two values.
