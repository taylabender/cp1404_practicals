# CP1404 Practical Reflection
"""
Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
- 98% - forgot to watch the last video in Lecture 2B because I was saving it for when I had the time to
    go through GitHub, then only remembered after struggling for 3 hours getting the program sorted.


## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
- At uni or home on Tuesdays, I have no other lectures on that day.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
- Following the lectures as the lecturer has intended. Stopping and writing
    code when he suggests rather than skipping it to get through the lectures.
    Writing the short-cuts for coding down when the lecture mentions them in
    the videos.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
- Allowing myself more time to get through the practices. I hope that they
    only take an hour or two, then I become stressed and annoyed at myself
    for taking longer.
- Need to change that I'm not doing the extensions. I need to make more time to
    go through them so I can learn more.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
- Remembering the functions and how to structure the code properly. I know this comes with
    repetition, but it's frustrating when I need to look back at other code to see how I did
    it then. Also, not very good at hand-writing code.


## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
- Not giving up and looking at the solutions straight away. I will try figure it for a good while
    before checking where I went wrong. And only twice did I end up checking, other times I had
    managed to figure it out.
