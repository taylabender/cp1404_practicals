# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate time compared actual time was inconsistent. Sometimes I finished the exercise
well before my estimate time, and other time taking double the estimate time. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

For the first couple of weeks, my estimate times were pretty accurate with the actual 
time it took me to finish the exercise. However, the last two weeks I underestimated how
long the exercises would take me. Sometimes taking double the time I had estimated.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Through this estimation process, I learned the critical importance of allocating 
sufficient time for tasks. Despite initial appearances, assignments can be more complex 
and time-consuming than they first seem.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Most common review by other people was to add more docstrings and comments in
my code. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

1. Consistent coding standards are critical for team productivity. By reviewing 
other peoples code, it highlighted the significance of following established style 
guides, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.
2. There's always room for improvement
3. Code reviews are a great opportunity to identify potential code improvements, 
unnecessary complexity, or more refine solutions that may not be apparent to me or 
overseen. 

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review 1](https://github.com/danny-zaw/cp1404practicals/pull/4#event-15344086237)

### Explanation

This review was short as the programmer had good code. However, I had suggested some minor
changes that could be made to improve their code. 

### Good Code Review 2

[Review 2](https://github.com/Primadeb/cp1404practicals/pull/5#issuecomment-2495135214)

### Explanation

Upon thorough review, I found the code to be well-written and offered a supportive comment.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were responsible for designing this subject, I would maintain its current structure, which 
I found highly effective. The short lecture videos with interactive 'do this now' exercises and 
pop-up questions maintained my focus. While the weekly practicals and tests initially seemed demanding, 
they ensured I kept up each week and prevented procrastination. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Taking the time to complete the practicals and following the tasks guidelines instead of 
over complicating things. By resisting the urge to add unnecessary complexity, I was able to meet 
the core objectives of each practical exercise while maintaining clarity and precision in my work.
