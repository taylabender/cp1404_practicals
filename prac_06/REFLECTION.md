# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
To be honest, I have not changed anything in my process. I have improved with writing code compared
to the first few weeks due to practice. However, I have not been able to do any extended exercises
due to time constrains. Between working two jobs and studying 4 subjects, there is no time for the 
extended exercises. I would like to change this after two weeks time when I finish my 3 semester subjects. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I want to modify my approach to writing code by incorporating pseudocode as a useful practice, 
particularly for other programming languages.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
Finishing the lecture videos by Tuesday latest so that I can work on the practical
exercises throughout the week.  


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
- To try and start assignments when they are first released, and to know my way around
    GitHub better! 
- To not leave anything for the weekend, even if its 'just a little bit of code to do'. I 
    work 15-17 hours on Saturday and 7 hours on Sunday. I am too exhausted to use my brain and 
    might end up deleting all my code again. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I don't have any request. I really like the way the subject is taught and I feel like I am learning a 
lot from it. :)
